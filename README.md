I'm DimenCode (DimenSpace on most other places), but I guess you can call me Dimen.
I'm between 18 and 28 years old, I mainly use Linux, and I enjoy programming in Java, Python and Bash.
If you really wish to contact me, well I'd prefer if you didn't, but if you really want to : @dimenspace on discord.
